This is the notebook of Thraal, 
Artificer of the Kingdom of Nor.  I have 
been studying the machines that lie in 
this Satellite.  I have a way to combine 
the parts to form a golem, a *robot*, 
using the same incantation that I use to 
view signs and scrolls in my home world.  
I have discovered that in order to bring 
the robot to life I must utter the 
following spell:


chmod +x robot

I have labeled the four parts alpha, 
beta, gamma, delta, but that is not the 
order I must combine them.  I must pass 
the combined parts into another spell 
which I will document below.  The first 
incantation I tried was thus:

cat alpha beta gamma delta | base64 -d > robot

...but that was met with the following error:  

base64:  invalid input

I will attempt every combination and 
document the one that succeeds.  I

alpha beta delta gamma 
alpha delta bet

There appears to be dried blood on the 
notebook, and the rest of the pages are 
blank.
